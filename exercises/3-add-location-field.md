# 3. Add location field

We got a new requirement to store a location for each task. Our backend team already added the `location` field. Here's what you need to do:

1. Add another text input for location, with label Location.
2. Pass the location value to `createToDo` API. To do so, give this text field an id
3. Test and verify location of new tasks are stored in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrYy4pqloELiJNOm)

### Here's the expected outcome
