# Ensemble Documentation

This repo contains Ensemble docs hosted at [docs.ensembleui.com](https://docs.ensembleui.com).

## Contributing to the docs directly on GitHub

Because Ensemble docs are created directly from the markdown in this repo, you can use the GitHub web editor to edit and propose changes to the docs directly from your browser without any knowledge of git. To do that, find the markdown file with the docs you want to edit and follow [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository) to edit and propose changes to a markdown file. Once approved, the docs will be updated immediately.
