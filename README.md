# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Documentation pages are written in Markdown, and located under the `docs` directory.

### Deployment

Merging to `main` branch will trigger the build and deployment process to Firebase ([project link](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ensemble-docs/overview)).

Live content is accessible at: [docs.ensembleui.com](https://docs.ensembleui.com)
