# 2. Add a header

Our UX designer is not happy because we forgot to add a header. Using the `Text` widget, add "My tasks" above the list. We also got the following styling requirements from the designer:

* Font size is 22
* Font weight is bold

The properties you need to set on `Text` widget are `text` and `styles`.

### Here's the expected outcome
