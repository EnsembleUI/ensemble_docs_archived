# 1. Add a title

Our UX designer is not happy because we forgot to add a title. Add "My tasks" above the list. We also got the following styling requirements from the designer:

* Font size is 22
* Font weight is bold

### Here's the expected outcome

<img src="/img/exercise_1.jpg" alt="Exercise 1" width="300"/>
