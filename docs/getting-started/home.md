# Welcome to Ensemble

Ensemble is a declarative platform for collaboratively building modern user interfaces.

With Ensemble, you create user interfaces by defining them using a declarative language. Ensemble is designed to focus on the visual and interactive aspects of your application, allowing you to specify the widget tree, interactions, events, and more. This user-centric approach makes it ideal for designing and prototyping user interfaces across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web, and desktop apps. By using Ensemble's client libraries, your application's user interface can be rendered consistently, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.

You can get feedback on your UI from your stakeholders through the Ensemble Preview apps on Apple Appstore. Once ready, you can use Ensemble SDK to help you develop your app anyway you like and submit it to Apple Appstore for approval.
