# Welcome to Ensemble

Ensemble is a declerative platform for building native front-ends.

With Ensemble, you create apps by defining them using a declarative language. Ensemble renders your app by interpretting this definition at runtime. This is acheived using Ensemble's client libraries. These libraries are native to the platform, which means your app will be rendered natively. In other words, it's not a web view. Ensemble's declarative language is purpose-built for front-end development so you can specify the widget tree, interactions, API calls, events, etc. In short, anything you need to build a front-end, you define in Ensemble. The same definition can be targetted at iOS, Android, web, and desktop apps.

Ensemble never generates code from your app definitions. The backend serve these definitions as-is to the client. This approach provides the following benefits:


1. **Instant update of native apps** - Ensemble apps can load the screen definitions locally or from a server. By putting them on the server, you can push updates to clients instantly.
2. **No more framework upgrades** - As new native technologies are released, we update Ensemble's runtime libraries, freeing you from spending resources to stay on latest framework releases.
3. **Standardize development of native apps around one technology** - You can target the same definition across iOS, Android, and web, and deliver native apps. Ensemble also enables customization per platform.
