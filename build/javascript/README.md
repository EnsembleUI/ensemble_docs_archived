# Welcome!
Welcome to the Ensemble Javascript manual. It provides how-to guides, API reference documentation and examples. 
## Limitations
Ensemble's javascript is a limited subset of the javascript you may be used to. It is used primarily for manipulating the JSON response from the server, doing UI logic when handling events or writing re-usable functions. 

- Only supports ES5. Which means that it does *not* support any of the ES6 features listed [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp). There is *no* support for arrow function synatx (=>), let keyword and many other features you may be used to. 
- Limited to what's provided outside the box. No support for importing libraries.
