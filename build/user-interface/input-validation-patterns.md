# Form Input Validation - Interaction Patterns

Ensemble supports 3 form input validation patterns out of the box with just configurations. We also provide a number of properties and methods on input widgets and form that you can use to support any other patterns as you like. 

- Validate on Form Submit
- Validate on user interaction with the input field
- Hybrid: first time validate on Form submit and then on user interaction
- Custom interactions - use methods and properties
