# Welcome to Ensemble

Ensemble is a declarative platform for building front-ends.

With Ensemble, you create front-ends by defining them using a declarative language. Ensemble renders your app by interpreting this definition at runtime. This is achieved using Ensemble's client libraries. Ensemble's declarative language is purpose-built for front-end development so you can specify the widget tree, interactions, API calls, events, etc. In short, anything you need to build a front-end, you define in Ensemble. The same definition can be rendered on iOS, Android, web, and desktop apps.
