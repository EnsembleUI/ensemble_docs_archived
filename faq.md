### What do I need to know to use Ensemble?

We've designed Ensemble for both ease of use and flexibility. You can start with little or no programming background, however, experience with the following will help:

* Writing YAML - Ensemble apps are written in YAML
* Using command line - To run an app locally, or publish an Ensemble app, you will run a few commands to generate the release build.
* JavaScript - While not necessary, you can add custom logic in JavaScript. We're talking basic experessions like if/else conditions or looping through an array.
