#### Exploring the [Kitchen Sink example](https://studio.ensembleui.com/app/e24402cb-75e2-404c-866c-29e6c3dd7992/screen/4aAgiwyVyucOAilPNy0s), let's delve into the process that repeats as users interact with the app, triggering events and updating the UI based on the defined logic and configurations.

Upon the View's loading, we initiate the following code block:
```yaml
executeCode:
      body: |-
        ensemble.storage.events = generateEvents();
```
This loads in all hardcoded objects  within the `generateEvents()` function, as outlined in the `Global: |-` block.

A notable quirk is encountered when dealing with bindings â€“ setting storage to something (even itself) triggers them. The Calendar example illustrates this perfectly:
```yaml
executeCode:
    body: |-
        var newEvent = {'start_date': calendar.rangeStart, 'end_date': calendar.rangeEnd, 'title': nameInput.value, 'detail': descInput.value}; 
        ensemble.storage.events.push(newEvent);
        ensemble.storage.events = ensemble.storage.events;
        console.log(ensemble.storage.events);
    onComplete:
        navigateBack:
```
Here, we start by appending/pushing our new event into our `ensemble.storage.events` array. However, to activate the binding for the updated array, we set it equal to itself, completing the cycle.
