# Row

Row is designed to arrange child widgets horizontally, where the intrinsic sizes of child widgets dictate the layout's appearance.

## Best Practices

- Use Row to lay out the children horizontally from left to right. Enable scrollable if the children might exceed the available space.
- **Avoid** using child widgets with no width constraint or sized itself to the parent (e.g. form inputs such as TextInput) inside the Row. [FlexRow](/widget-reference/flex-row.md) may be a better choice in this case.
- Avoid using nested scrollable Row for better UX.

## Key Concepts
- **mainAxisSize**: By default the width of a `Row` is determined by its parent's width constraint (if available), otherwise it will be the combined width of its children. You may force the Row to do the later (size itself to the children's combined width) with `mainAxisSize=min`.
- **mainAxis**: This property controls the horizontal alignment of the children within the Row. This property is useful only when the mainAxisSize is set to max (default) as there are available spaces to align the children.
- **crossAxis**: This property controls the vertical alignment of the children within the Row.
- **scrollable**: Enable horizontal scrolling when the child widgets grow wider than the available space.
