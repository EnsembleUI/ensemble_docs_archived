# Column

Column is designed to arrange child widgets vertically, where the intrinsic sizes of child widgets dictate the layout's appearance.

## Best Practices

- If a single vertical scrollbar is needed for the entire screen, consider using `scrollableView: true` at the `View` level.
- If the entire screen's vertical space is used without a need for scrolling (or if the scrolling is inside some nested section), considered using FlexColumn](/widget-reference/flex-column.md) to fill the entire vertical space.
- Use Column to lay out the children vertically from top to bottom. Enable scrollable if the children might exceed the available space.
- **Avoid** using child widgets with no height constraint or sized itself to the parent inside the Column.
- **Avoid** using nested scrollable Column for better UX.

## Key Concepts
- **mainAxisSize**: By default the height of a Column is determined by its parent's height constraint (if available), otherwise it will be the combined height of its children. You may force the Column to do the later (size itself to the children's combined height) with `mainAxisSize=min`. Note that a Column does not pass a height constraint to its children, so a Column inside another Column will always size itself to its children. 
- **mainAxis**: This property controls the vertical alignment of the children within the Column. This property is useful only when the mainAxisSize is set to max (default) as there are available spaces to align the children.
- **crossAxis**: This property controls the horizontal alignment of the children within the Column.
- **scrollable**: Enable vertical scrolling when the child widgets grow wider than the available space.
